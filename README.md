Aloha! I'm @moonlit-edelweiss, simply known as Weiss.

I am a hobbyist mod developer for the Source Engine, and generally develop things in general.
"things" is the best descriptor, honestly, because a lot of this stuff you'll find here is purely for personal use or because I was simply bored.
Still, uploading your projects is better than having nothing to show at all, so...
